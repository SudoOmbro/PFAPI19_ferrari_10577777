A fast program to monitor a large number of entities and relations between them.

This project was made for a University Exam. It uses hash tables and Binary trees to manage all the data.

There are 6 commands:

 - addent "Entity name"
 - delent "Entity name"
 - addrel "Source Entity" "Destination Entity" "Relation name"
 - delrel "Source Entity" "Destination Entity" "Relation name"
 - report
 - end
 
 the "" are needed around names.
 
 the "report" command prints, for every relation, the name of said relation, 
 which is(are) the entity(s) with the most relation and the max number of entering relations.
